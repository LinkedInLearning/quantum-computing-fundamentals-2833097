# Quantum Computing Fundamentals
This is the repository for the LinkedIn Learning course Quantum Computing Fundamentals. The full course is available from [LinkedIn Learning][lil-course-url].

### UPDATE: THESE EXAMPLES HAVE BEEN MODIFIED SINCE RECORDING TO ADDRESS API-BREAKING CHANGES IN QISKIT v1.0
This course was originally recorded in November 2022 using `Qiskit v0.13`. Since then, Qiskit 1.0 was released and included several major changes to the API that broke the prior examples.

The examples in this repo have been updated to utilize the new Qiskit API. This primarily affects the import statements at the beginning of notebooks and the measurements/visualations at the end. These API changes should not impact learning the course's core concepts.

This course is integrated with GitHub Codespaces, an instant cloud developer environment that offers all the functionality of your favorite IDE without the need for any local machine setup. With GitHub Codespaces, you can get hands-on practice from any machine, at any time—all while using a tool that you’ll likely encounter in the workplace. Check out the “Using GitHub Codespaces with this course” video to learn how to get started. 


 
In this course, electrical engineer and educator Barron Stone guides you through how to deploy quantum computing from a developer’s perspective. Learn about qubits, quantum logic gates and circuits, running quantum programs with Qiskit, three common quantum algorithms, and more. This course is a perfect companion to the course Introduction to Quantum Computing.
